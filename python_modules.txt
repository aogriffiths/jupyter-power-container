 # objects to the majority of the built-in python types

numba
 # https://numba.pydata.org/
 # Numba gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance
 # functions written directly in Python. With a few annotations, array-oriented
 # and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time compiled to native machine
 # instructions, similar in performance to C, C++ and Fortran, without having to
 # switch languages or Python interpreters.

bokeh
 # https://bokeh.pydata.org/
 # Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web
 # browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise
 # construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this
 # capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming
 # datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create
 # interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
